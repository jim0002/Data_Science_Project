# Task
I have applied K means clustering on an unsupervised dataset. To do so, first of all I have selected and downloaded a dataset named “vehicle.csv” from kaggle. In this dataset there are 847 instances and 19 attributes where 18 of them are numerical and only one attribute (“class”) is categorical, which is the target attribute of this dataset. To consider this dataset as an unsupervised dataset I didn't consider the “class” attribute while applying k means clustering. In the first 18 attribute various features and measurements of vehicle is mentioned. From this information I have visualized some clusters which contained the same type of vehicle.
